The label generation for the probability map is inspired by [PSENet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12473). Given a text image, each polygon of its text regions is described by a set of segments:

$$G=\lbrace S_n \rbrace_{k=1}^n$$

$n$ is the number of vertexes (which may be different datasets). Then the positive area is generated by shrinking the polygon $G$ to $G_s$ using the Vatti clipping algorithm
